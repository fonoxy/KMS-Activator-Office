- **PHP Version**: >= 5.3
- **PHP Extensions**:

By default the python script will look for `yourdomain.com/kms/office/` if you want to change this edit line `8` in the file `/client/main.py` by changing `r`.

```python
def setup(h="http://au.ldtp.com",kh="au.ldtp.com",r="/kms/office"):
```

Also set  `h` and `kh` to your domain and KMS server. Include `https://` or `http://` for `h`.

In the `/website/index.php` file change line `2` include a `/` at the start and the end.

```php
$root = "/kms/office/versions/"
```
